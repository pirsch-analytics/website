This comes at a cost. Using it on your website means youâ€™re paying big-tech with the personal information of your visitors.</p><p>A growing number of people with ad blockers and not accounted for by GA and make the data unreliable. Cookie-consent banners increase the loading time of your website and annoy visitors.</p><p>The dashboard is unintuitive, slow, and frustrating to use.

Switching between as many websites as you want makes Pirsch a good choice for web agencies and freelancers.</p><h2>Import Your Data</h2><p>Google Universal Analytics (GA3) will be shut down on July 1st, 2023.
