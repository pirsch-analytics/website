                    "answer": "Pirsch is <a href='/privacy-friendly-analytics' rel='noreferrer'>privacy-friendly</a> by design. To achieve this, it uses the HTTP protocol to recognise users. It generates a hash for each visitor, calculated from the visitor's IP address, User-Agent and other data points, to ensure that statistics are anonymized."

                    "answer": "Yes, you can download all your statistics into <a href='https://docs.pirsch.io/dashboard/settings/#export-to-csv' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>CSV files</a> from the settings page. We also provide an API to work with the data in your tools."

                    "question": "How is the monthly limit calculated?",
                    "answer": "The monthly limit is based on the number of page views, events, and 10% of session extensions since the start of your billing cycle. Deleted domains also count towards your limit until it is reset."
                },
                {
                    "question": "What happens when I reach my monthly page view limit?",
                    "answer": "If you reach the usage limit before the end of your billing period, your access will be limited to the day you reached the limit. We will continue to collect data for your sites for a further five days. To regain access to your statistics and avoid gaps, you must upgrade your plan within those five days or wait until your usage limit is reset."

                    "question": "Which payment options are available?",

                {
                    "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
                    "answer": "Yes, you can change your plan at any time. If you downgrade, the difference will be added to your balance for the remainder of your billing cycle. If you upgrade at a later date, your balance will be used first."
