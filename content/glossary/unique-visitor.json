Each unique visitor is counted only once during that period, regardless of how often they visit the site. This metric helps website owners understand the size of their audience.</p><p>For example, with Pirsch Analytics, a website visited multiple times in a day by the same user is still counted as a single visitor. This distinction is important to measure true reach, not just the level of activity reflected in metrics such as <a href=\"/glossary/page-view\">page views</a> or <a href=\"/glossary/session\">sessions</a>.</p>"
