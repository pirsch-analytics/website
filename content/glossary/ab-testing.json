This is done by showing the two versions (A and B) to similar visitors at the same time and then statistically analyzing which version performs better on pre-defined metrics such as click-through rate, form completions, or purchases.</p><p>For example, a website might test two different <a href=\"/glossary/landing-page\">landing page</a> designs to see which one leads to more newsletter signups. Using tools like Pirsch Analytics, the site owner can measure which version has a higher sign-up rate and then implement the more effective design for all visitors.</p><p>A/B testing is an essential tool for website optimization because it enables data-driven decisions, reduces guesswork, and improves user engagement by optimizing elements based on actual user behavior.</p>"
