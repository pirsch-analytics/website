This category of traffic is important because it often indicates a level of brand awareness or loyalty, as the user has specifically chosen to visit the site without the influence of a search engine or other referral source.</p><p>For example, if someone remembers a promotional URL from a flyer or ad and types it directly into their browser, that visit would be classified as direct traffic. Tools like Pirsch Analytics would categorize these <a href=\"/glossary/session\">sessions</a> separately to help webmasters understand how much of their traffic is coming from users with prior knowledge of the brand.</p><p>Understanding direct traffic can help companies measure brand awareness and loyalty, and it can also highlight potential problems with tracking other traffic sources if direct traffic numbers are unusually high.</p>"
