The concept encompasses various legal frameworks designed to protect personal data and communications from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.</p><p>In the European Union, ePrivacy is particularly associated with the ePrivacy Directive, also known as the Cookie Law, which regulates the use of <a href=\"/glossary/cookie\">cookies</a>, the confidentiality of communications, and the security of networks and services. This directive complements the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href=\"/glossary/gdpr\">GDPR</a>) by focusing on the protection of electronic communications and the tracking of internet users more broadly.</p><p>Compliance with the ePrivacy Directive includes, for example, obtaining explicit consent from users before placing cookies on their <a href=\"/glossary/device\">devices</a>, ensuring the security of electronic communications, and providing clear information about data collection and use.</p>"
