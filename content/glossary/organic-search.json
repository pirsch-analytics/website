These results are derived from the search engine's assessment of a page's relevance and authority, which is typically influenced by factors such as content quality, <a href=\"/glossary/keyword\">keyword</a> relevance, and backlink profiles, to name a few. Organic search is crucial for generating long-term traffic to a website and is often viewed by users as more trustworthy than paid search results.</p><p>For example, when a user types a search query into a search engine such as Google, the list of websites that appear without the label \"Ad\" are organic search results. Sites attempt to optimize their content through <a href=\"/glossary/search-engine-optimization\">SEO</a> (search engine optimization) to rank higher in these organic search results. Ranking high in organic search results can significantly increase website visibility, user trust and traffic without the cost of paid advertising.</p><p>Optimizing the <a href=\"/glossary/page-title\">page title</a> for relevance and appeal can significantly impact a web page's visibility in search results and <a href=\"/glossary/click-through-rate\">click-through rate</a>, which has a direct impact on the success of a website's content marketing and SEO efforts.</p>"
