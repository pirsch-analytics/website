Landing pages are designed to offer fewer distractions and guide visitors to the intended <a href=\"/glossary/conversion\">conversion</a> goal.</p><p>For example, when an ad for a product is clicked, the landing page associated with that ad may contain detailed information about the product, testimonials, and a purchase link. The effectiveness of a landing page can be measured by its <a href=\"/glossary/conversion-rate\">conversion rate</a>, which indicates how often visitors who land on the page take the desired action, such as filling out a form or making a purchase.</p><p>Optimizing landing pages involves testing different elements such as headlines, text, images and layout to see which combinations result in the highest conversion rate.
