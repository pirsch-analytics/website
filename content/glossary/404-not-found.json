This error typically occurs when a user tries to access a Web page or file that does not exist on the server. The error can be the result of an incorrectly entered <a href=\"/glossary/uniform-resource-locator\">URL</a>, a moved or deleted file, or a broken link on the Web site.</p><p>For example, if a visitor follows a link to an article that has been deleted or moved without a redirect set up, the server will return a 404 Not Found error.This error serves as feedback that the attempted path did not lead to a valid web page.</p><p>Monitoring and managing 404 errors is important for website maintenance and user experience. Regularly fixing broken links, implementing redirects for displaced content, and creating a helpful 404 error page can improve site navigation and keep users engaged even when they've reached a dead end.</p>"
