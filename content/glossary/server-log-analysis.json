                        "text": "<p>Server log analysis examines the logs generated by a web server to gain insight into the traffic, performance, and security issues of the site. Server logs are files that record various events on the web server, such as visitor requests, server responses, error messages, and other transaction details. Analyzing these logs can help administrators understand traffic patterns, identify potential security vulnerabilities, and troubleshoot technical problems.</p><p>For example, by reviewing server logs, a site administrator can see which pages are most frequently requested, detect unusual spikes in traffic that could indicate a bot attack, and identify error codes that could indicate problems with site functionality. This analysis is critical to maintaining the health and security of a website. Tools such as Webalizer or AWStats can be used to automate the analysis process and provide visual reports that make it easier to interpret the data contained in the server logs.</p><p>The analysis of server logs is a fundamental aspect of website monitoring that ensures smooth operation and improves the overall security and efficiency of a website.</p>"
