This type of analysis helps advertisers understand how their paid search efforts are contributing to their marketing goals, such as generating leads, increasing sales, or improving brand awareness. Key metrics often reviewed include <a href=\"/glossary/click-through-rate\">click-through rates</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/cost-per-click\">cost-per-click</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/conversion-rate\">conversion rates</a>, and overall <a href=\"/glossary/return-on-investment\">ROI</a>.</p><p>For example, an ecommerce business might use paid search analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of its Google Ads campaign for \"summer dresses\". By analyzing data like the number of clicks, the cost of each click, and the number of conversions from these clicks, the business can determine whether the campaign is cost-effective and meeting expected sales targets. Based on this analysis, adjustments can be made to bid strategies, keyword selections, or ad copy to optimize the campaign's performance.</p><p>Paid search analysis is essential for marketers to ensure that they are investing wisely in their advertising efforts and achieving the best possible returns on their spend.</p>"
