                        "text": "<p>The click-through rate (CTR) is an important metric in web analytics and digital marketing that measures the ratio of users who click on a particular link to the total number of users who view a page, email, or ad. It is often used to measure the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns and the performance of email marketing efforts. CTR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions (i.e., the number of times an ad or email is viewed) and multiplying the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.</p><p>For example, if an ad on a website is viewed 1,000 times and receives 10 clicks, then the CTR for that ad would be as follows:</p><p>CTR = (number of clicks / number of impressions) x 100 = (10 / 1,000) x 100 = 1%</p><p>A higher CTR indicates that a higher percentage of people who viewed the content found it attractive enough to click through.</p><p>CTR is crucial for optimizing ad campaigns, improving content, and increasing the effectiveness of calls to action in emails or <a href=\"/glossary/landing-page\">landing pages</a> , which ultimately leads to better conversion rates.
