                        "text": "<p>Return on investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the efficiency and profitability of an investment. In the context of web analytics and digital marketing, ROI measures the revenue generated by digital campaigns in relation to the cost of those campaigns. It helps companies assess which marketing strategies are most effective in generating revenue and achieving business goals.</p><p>For example, if a company spends $1,000 on a digital advertising campaign and generates $5,000 in revenue as a result, ROI can be calculated by subtracting the cost of the investment from the profit, then dividing by the cost of the investment and finally converting to a percentage. This can be expressed mathematically as ROI = [(5,000 - 1,000) / 1,000] * 100% = 400%. This means that for every dollar spent, the company has received four dollars back.</p><p>Calculating ROI allows companies to make informed decisions about allocating resources, optimizing marketing strategies, and justifying digital marketing spend by demonstrating tangible results.</p>"
